When I tell people this today, they laugh and nod as if they understand, as if they too are part of a secret book-addict society whose greatest crime is staying up late, a flashlight under the covers, compulsively reading page after page. The strange thing is, no one ever asks me what my second addiction is. I mean, someone who loved to read could never be a real addict, could they? The kind of addict who steals from their family, betrays the people they love, commits felonies, implodes their life because the finding and using and finding more consumes every ounce of who they used to be. No one ever loses their job because they read too much. There are no book club interventions. The prisons aren\\u2019t full of people who stole to fund their Kindle habit. The truth is I\\u2019ve only ever had one addiction. The white whale of addictions: escape. From as far back as I can remember there has always been a better place than wherever I am. A better me than whoever I was. Books helped me escape when I was young. Not just because of my precocious angsty-ness and early onset existential crises; they were literal escape. Most of my early childhood memories are just stories told to me decades later. Stories of violence and starvation and abandonment. I do remember every teacher, though, from kindergarten through high school. I remember the first multisyllabic word I read in school: policeman. I was so proud of myself as I sounded out the letters. In first grade I read Gone with the Wind\\u2014twice. It was over a thousand pages. I didn\\u2019t understand Rhett Butler or Scarlett O\\u2019Hara or the Civil War, but I savored the endless tiny print pages of word after word. I savored the escape. The longer the book the better. The only clear memories I have besides school after the age of ten are of moments of crisis. My brothers stealing my stepfather\\u2019s Pinto and sinking it in Walden Pond. The police bringing my sister home for public drunkenness. My aunt Janice arriving from San Francisco in the middle of the night, her face swollen and unrecognizable\\u2014a mix of red, black, and blue. My brothers and sister dancing around my stepfather\\u2019s finger that they found on the front lawn after my mom rushed him bleeding to the hospital. It was a lawn mower accident of some sort, and it was the only time I remember my siblings expressing joy. I didn\\u2019t know why they hated my stepfather so much, or what made him pack up one day and leave for good. I don\\u2019t have a single memory of eating dinner at home with my family. I don\\u2019t recall any vacations. If I try to remember my childhood, there is only a vague sense of fear, of unease. I have no clear picture of anything concrete or symbolic representing home, and with two of my siblings dying young, I don\\u2019t have anyone left to fill in the blanks. I only see myself alone in my room, reading. And not in a meet-cute, flashlight-under-the-covers, love-affair-with-books kind of way. When I talk about my childhood book addiction, I\\u2019m talking about a desperate grip on the pages, reading the same books over and over, never having enough pages to fill the void. When I read, I could pretend I was someone else. I was Harriet the Spy, Nancy Drew, Lucy in Narnia. I was Scarlett O\\u2019Hara declaring she would never go hungry again. I was a teenager visiting California for the first time, meeting the boy of her dreams, and fighting all night to keep the distant family\\u2019s orange grove from freezing in a cold spell. I was a feisty woman who didn\\u2019t need a man until she desperately needed him in every Nora Roberts book ever written. Because we moved from Maynard to Concord, I also read Alcott, Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Emerson. I read Tolstoy and Dostoevsky but found Russian relationships to be far more confusing than the ones in Nora Roberts\\u2019s worlds. I loved happy endings, characters who had clear motivations for doing what they did. I read books like a peeping Tom, and I stalked all these lives that weren\\u2019t mine. Even the sad people in books had moments of joy and redemption that I envied. Eventually the reading turned to writing. I started writing short stories in high school and they got me the attention I hungered for. I always loved school. I played varsity lacrosse and field hockey. I could be friends with the cool kids and the smart kids and the sporty kids and even the stoner kids although I didn\\u2019t like to get stoned. I could cross social lines seamlessly and be whoever people needed me to be. I\\u2019d like to say it was a gift born of my curiosity about people, but in truth it was more of a response to trauma. I wanted to be loved. I wanted to feel safe. So I needed every single person I met to like me, and if I could make them love and need me, even better. After school I went home with different friends and did homework at their kitchen table and joined their family for dinner. At each home I could pretend I was exactly who they thought I must be. Everyone\\u2019s parents loved me, except my own. I was the first person in my family to get into college. I took out loans and put myself through undergrad and graduate school three thousand miles away. I reinvented myself in California. I moved into the dorms at UC Santa Cruz and wore tie-dye shirts and played Ultimate Frisbee. I hung tapestries in my dorm room and slept with my resident adviser. Then I slept with his best friend. No one could believe, with my long beach-blond hair and my flowing hippie scarves, that I grew up in Massachusetts. The first week of college I tried mushrooms, and cocaine, and LSD. They were passed around like candy during orientation week. Who I was before college was quickly tucked away on a shelf. That Lara was over, and I was officially a carefree peace-and-love California surfer girl. I majored in creative writing, because that meant I could keep reading, keep writing, and keep escaping. I thought I could outrun whatever afflicted my family, and I swore I wo\n问题：Narrives: 1.
