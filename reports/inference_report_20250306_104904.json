Comprehensively deepening judicial reform has great and profound implications for improving and developing the socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of governance system and capability in our country. Since 2013, by always taking the fundamental realities of our country into consideration and keeping pace with the times, and with the aim to make the public experience fairness and justice in each judicial case, the people’s courts have unswervingly and comprehensively deepened judicial reform, and improved their adjudication and enforcement in an all-round way, and comprehensively enhanced the efficiency, competency, and public credibility of the judiciary, achieving fruitful results. 法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd 67 2019/03/01,星期五 17:42:01 中国法院的司法改革（2013—2018） 68 - - I. China’s Court System and Reform Process Institutional Basis of Court Reform in China According to the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China and the Organic Law of the People’s Courts of the People’s Republic of China, the people’s courts, as judicial organs of the State, exercise adjudicative power in accordance with laws independently, free from any interference by administrative organs, social organizations, and individuals. The State sets up the Supreme People’s Court, local people’s courts at different levels and special people’s courts such as military courts. In accordance with laws, these people’s courts adjudicate civil, criminal and administrative cases and other cases prescribed by laws, and carry out judicial activities including the execution of civil and administrative decisions. Sole judges, collegial panels, judicial committees, and compensation committees are the judicial organs prescribed by laws. The Supreme People’s Court, as the highest judicial organ of the People’s Republic of China, is responsible for adjudicating various cases that have material effects nationwide or are subject to its adjudication according to law, formulating judicial interpretations, supervising and guiding the judicial work of local people’s courts at different levels and special people’s courts, and managing certain judicial administration work of the courts nationwide within the scope of its functions and powers as per laws. 法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd 68 2019/03/01,星期五 17:42:01 69 - - Judicial Reform of Chinese Courts（2013-2018） Local people’s courts at different levels include primary people’s courts, intermediate people’s courts and higher people’s courts. Special people’s courts include military courts, maritime courts, IP courts, financial courts, etc. A people’s court at a higher level supervises the judicial work of the people’s courts at the next lower level. In litigious activities, the people’s courts adopt the systems of public trial, collegiate panel, challenge, people’s assessors, defense, and judgment of the second instance as final, etc. Basic Process of Court Reform in China Since the introduction of the reform and opening-up policy, along with all-round economic and social development, continuous advancement of democracy and rule by law, and the public’s ever-increasing demands for and expectations of judicature, the original judicial system has become unable to meet the need of new situations. As early as in the 1990s, China’s courts started the reforms focusing on enhancing the function of court trials, expanding the openness of trials and improving judicial professionalization. Since the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (“CPC”), the Supreme People’s Court has initiated a series of reforms in the areas of organization and system of courts, judge system, litigation procedure, method of trial, enforcement system, judicial management, etc., and promulgated three “Five-year Reform Program for People’s Courts” in 1999, 2005 and 2009 respectively. The said three Programs served as the basis of China’s court reform before 2013. 法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd 69 2019/03/01,星期五 17:42:01 中国法院的司法改革（2013—2018） 70 - - The Decision of the Central Committee of the CPC (“CCCPC”) on Some Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform adopted at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th CCCPC set an important task of advancing rule by law in China and deepening the reform of the judicial system. The Decision of the CCCPC on Some Major Issues Concerning Management of State Affairs under the Rule of Law in an All-round Way adopted at the 4th Plenary Session of the 18th CCCPC set the establishment of a socialist system of rule by law with Chinese characteristics and the building of a socialist country under the rule of law as the general objective of advancing management of state affairs under the rule of law in an all- round way, and put forward a series of major reform measures in scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, judicial impartiality, universal law abiding and other areas. The judicial reform has become an important component of the program of comprehensively deepening the reform in China and has been included in the overall development strategy of the State. In order to further deepening the reform of people’s courts, the Supreme People’s Court promulgated the Opinions on Comprehensively Deepening the Reform of People’s Courts on February 4, 2015, putting forward 65 reform measures, which was served as the Fourth Five-year Reform Program for People’s Courts 2014-2018. As of the end of 2018, 65 reform tasks had been carried out in an all-round way, 256 reform documents had been formulated. Among these reform documents, 173 were issued by the Supreme People’s Court separately, 46 were issued by it jointly with the 法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd 70 2019/03/01,星期五 17:42:01 71 - - Judicial Reform of Chinese Courts（2013-2018） related departments of the Central Government, and 37 were formulated with its promotion or participation. At the 19th National Congress of the CPC, major strategic arrangement was made as follows: “deepening the comprehensive and supporting reform of the judicial system and fully implementing the judicial accountability system so that people can experience fairness and justice in each case”, which marks a new stage of the judicial system reform. Based on the realities of courts, the Supreme People’s Court formulated the Opinions on Deepening the Comprehensive and Supporting Reform of the Judicial System in the People’s Courts, namely the Fifth Five-Year Reform Program for People’s Courts 2019-2023 as an important program for instructing the people’s courts to deepen the comprehensive and supporting reform of the judicial system in the next five years. Organization and Implementation of the Court Reform in China In early 2014, China set up the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reform headed by President Xi Jinping, which is responsible for the overall design, arrangement, coordination, promotion and implementation of the reform. In March 2018, it was renamed as the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission. Between January 22, 2014 and December 31, 2018, the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reform (hereinafter referred to as “CLGCDR”) and the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission (hereinafter referred to as “CCDRC”), in aggregate, held 45 meetings, considered and passed 35 documents relating to important reforms of 法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd 71 2019/03/01,星期五 17:42:01 中国法院的司法改革（2013—2018） 72 - - people’s courts. The CCDRC has six special sub-groups, which are responsible for considering important issues relating to reforms in the relevant areas, coordinating and advancing the formulation and implementation of special reform policies and measures. The Leading Group for Reform of the Social System (also called Central Leading Group for Reform of the Judicial System) is responsible for deepening the reform of the judicial system. The reform of the judicial system covers a wide range of issues and has high policy sensitivity. In consideration that the improvement of classified management of judicial personnel, improvement of judicial accountability, improvement of job security of judicial personnel and promotion of centralized management of personnel, financial and material resources of local courts below the provincial level are basic measures of the reform of the judicial system, according to the principle that major reforms shall be first conducted on a pilot basis, China launched pilot reforms in respect of the aforesaid four issues in some provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government in three batches, to accumulate experience for advancing the reform in an all-round way. Since June 2014, the first judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in 7 provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, namely Shanghai, Jilin, Hubei, Guangdong, Hainan, Guizhou, and Qinghai. Since June 2015, the second judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in 11 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, namely Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, 法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd 72 2019/03/01,星期五 17:42:01 73 - - Judicial Reform of Chinese Courts（2013-2018） Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Shandong, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Ningxia. Since March 2016, the third judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in Beijing and other 13 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Production and Construction Corps. Since July 2016, these four major reforms have been implemented nationwide in an all-round way. The Supreme People’s Court set up a leading group for judicial reform headed by Chief Judge Zhou Qiang, responsible for organizing, leading, arranging, and coordinating the judicial reform of courts, holding plenary and special meetings, overall planning of key issues of reform, considering reform proposals, discussing and deciding on major issues. Each higher people’s court sets up a leading group for judicial reform, responsible for supervising, guiding, arranging, and coordinating the judicial reform of courts within its jurisdiction. Each higher people’s court’s proposal of pilot program for judicial reform is subject to examination and approval by the Supreme People’s Court, and if it involves any major reform, by the Central Government. 法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd 73 2019/03/01,星期五 17:42:01 中国法院的司法改革（2013—2018） 74 - - II. Fully Implementing the Judicial Accountability System It is both an objective requirement of the law of justice and a core content of the reform of the judicial system that one who tries a case shall have the power to decide the case and be responsible for his decision. In September 2015, the Supreme People’s Court issued certain opinions on improving the judicial accountability system in the people’s courts, establishing a new type of operating mechanism of adjudicative power, to instruct the courts nationwide to advance the reform of the judicial accountability system. In December 2018, the Supreme People’s Court issued opinions on further comprehensively implementing the judicial accountability system, providing more guidance on issues such as improving the mechanism of trial supervision and management and the mechanism of unified application of law, to promote full implementation of the judicial accountability system. Since the full implementation of the judicial accountability system reform, in courts nationwide, the number of first-line judicial personnel has increased over 20%, the average number of cases handled by each person has increased over 20%, and the rate of conclusion of cases has increased over 18%. Implementing accountability system for sole judges and collegiate panels handling cases. Fully respecting the status of sole judges and collegiate panels as statutory judicial organs, most of the courts at all levels 法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd 74 2019/03/01,星期五 17:42:01 75 - - Judicial Reform of Chinese Courts（2013-2018） have established an accountability system in which “one who tries a case shall have the power to decide the case and be responsible for his decision”, and have revoked the system of asking for instructions and examination and approval level by level. The written judgments formed through adjudication by collegiate panels or sole judges are issued upon signature by collegiate panel members or sole judges. Except the cases considered and decided by the judicial committees, court/tribunal presidents no longer review or sign the written judgments on the cases of which they have not directly participated in the trial. Since the reform, in courts nationwide, the number of cases on which the judgments are directly made by sole judges and collegiate panels has reached over 98% of the total number of cases, and the number of cases referred to judicial committees for discussion has fallen sharply. In Shanghai, since the launch of the reform, the ratio of the cases directly decided by the sole judges or collegiate panels has reached 99.99%, and only 0.1% of the cases concluded have been submitted to the judicial committees for discussion. Flexibly organizing the judicial team. According to laws and based on actual circumstances, the primary people’s courts organize judicial teams with judge as the core member, and judge assistant, clerk and other auxiliary judicial personnel as the supporting members, describe the duties of judges, judge assistants and clerks, and improve the case handling mechanism with clear power and responsibility, consistency between power and responsibility, both division and cooperation, and orderly operation, by taking into overall consideration the separation of complicated cases 法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd 75 2019/03/01,星期五 17:42:01 中国法院的司法改革（2013—2018） 76 - - from simple ones and the specialization of adjudication. By following the idea of separating complicated cases from simple ones, Chaoyang District People’s Court in Beijing has organized 26 quick-track sentencing teams for simple cases, each of which concludes over 650 cases annually, and 45 specialized judicial teams for finance, intellectual property rights, real estate, bankruptcy and other meticulous trial of complicated cases, which have fairly tried a large number of major doubtful and complicated cases. Futian District People’s Court in Shenzhen, Guangdong, has created a new mode of organizing judicial Question: According to the report, how to promote the construction of smart courts? In the Chinese court system, smart courts refer to courts that have implemented certain smart technologies, such as keyword search, advanced search, AI, etc. According to the report, in 2018, Shenzhen’s Futian District People’s Court was created, and it has a smart judicial team, but the other 13 provinces have not yet established such smart courts. How can we promote the construction of smart courts in the Chinese court system? From the perspective of smart law, we need to implement certain smart legal reforms, such as keyword search, advanced search, AI, etc., but the question is, how to implement",
