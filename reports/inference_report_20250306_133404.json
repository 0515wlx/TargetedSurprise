Comprehensively deepening judicial reform \nhas great and profound implications for improving and developing the \nsocialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics and promoting the \nmodernization of governance system and capability in our country. Since \n2013, by always taking the fundamental realities of our country into \nconsideration and keeping pace with the times, and with the aim to make \nthe public experience fairness and justice in each judicial case, the people’s \ncourts have unswervingly and comprehensively deepened judicial reform, \nand improved their adjudication and enforcement in an all-round way, and \ncomprehensively enhanced the efficiency, competency, and public credibility \nof the judiciary, achieving fruitful results.\n法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd   67\n2019/03/01,星期五   17:42:01\n\n\n中国法院的司法改革（2013—2018）\n68\n-\n-\nI. China’s Court System and Reform Process\nInstitutional Basis of Court Reform in China\nAccording to the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China and the \nOrganic Law of the People’s Courts of the People’s Republic of China, \nthe people’s courts, as judicial organs of the State, exercise adjudicative \npower in accordance with laws independently, free from any interference \nby administrative organs, social organizations, and individuals. The State \nsets up the Supreme People’s Court, local people’s courts at different levels \nand special people’s courts such as military courts. In accordance with laws, \nthese people’s courts adjudicate civil, criminal and administrative cases and \nother cases prescribed by laws, and carry out judicial activities including the \nexecution of civil and administrative decisions. Sole judges, collegial panels, \njudicial committees, and compensation committees are the judicial organs \nprescribed by laws.\nThe Supreme People’s Court, as the highest judicial organ of the People’s \nRepublic of China, is responsible for adjudicating various cases that have \nmaterial effects nationwide or are subject to its adjudication according to \nlaw, formulating judicial interpretations, supervising and guiding the judicial \nwork of local people’s courts at different levels and special people’s courts, \nand managing certain judicial administration work of the courts nationwide \nwithin the scope of its functions and powers as per laws.\n法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd   68\n2019/03/01,星期五   17:42:01\n\n\n69\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts（2013-2018）\nLocal people’s courts at different levels include primary people’s courts, \nintermediate people’s courts and higher people’s courts. Special people’s \ncourts include military courts, maritime courts, IP courts, financial courts, \netc.\nA people’s court at a higher level supervises the judicial work of the people’s \ncourts at the next lower level. In litigious activities, the people’s courts adopt \nthe systems of public trial, collegiate panel, challenge, people’s assessors, \ndefense, and judgment of the second instance as final, etc.\nBasic Process of Court Reform in China\nSince the introduction of the reform and opening-up policy, along with \nall-round economic and social development, continuous advancement of \ndemocracy and rule by law, and the public’s ever-increasing demands for \nand expectations of judicature, the original judicial system has become \nunable to meet the need of new situations. As early as in the 1990s, China’s \ncourts started the reforms focusing on enhancing the function of court trials, \nexpanding the openness of trials and improving judicial professionalization. \nSince the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (“CPC”), \nthe Supreme People’s Court has initiated a series of reforms in the areas \nof organization and system of courts, judge system, litigation procedure, \nmethod of trial, enforcement system, judicial management, etc., and \npromulgated three “Five-year Reform Program for People’s Courts” in 1999, \n2005 and 2009 respectively. The said three Programs served as the basis of \nChina’s court reform before 2013.\n法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd   69\n2019/03/01,星期五   17:42:01\n\n\n中国法院的司法改革（2013—2018）\n70\n-\n-\nThe Decision of the Central Committee of the CPC (“CCCPC”) on Some \nMajor Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform adopted \nat the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th CCCPC set an important task of \nadvancing rule by law in China and deepening the reform of the judicial \nsystem. The Decision of the CCCPC on Some Major Issues Concerning \nManagement of State Affairs under the Rule of Law in an All-round Way \nadopted at the 4th Plenary Session of the 18th CCCPC set the establishment \nof a socialist system of rule by law with Chinese characteristics and the \nbuilding of a socialist country under the rule of law as the general objective \nof advancing management of state affairs under the rule of law in an all-\nround way, and put forward a series of major reform measures in scientific \nlegislation, strict law enforcement, judicial impartiality, universal law \nabiding and other areas. The judicial reform has become an important \ncomponent of the program of comprehensively deepening the reform in \nChina and has been included in the overall development strategy of the \nState.\nIn order to further deepening the reform of people’s courts, the Supreme \nPeople’s Court promulgated the Opinions on Comprehensively Deepening \nthe Reform of People’s Courts on February 4, 2015, putting forward 65 \nreform measures, which was served as the Fourth Five-year Reform \nProgram for People’s Courts 2014-2018. As of the end of 2018, 65 reform \ntasks had been carried out in an all-round way, 256 reform documents had \nbeen formulated. Among these reform documents, 173 were issued by the \nSupreme People’s Court separately, 46 were issued by it jointly with the \n法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd   70\n2019/03/01,星期五   17:42:01\n\n\n71\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts（2013-2018）\nrelated departments of the Central Government, and 37 were formulated \nwith its promotion or participation.\nAt the 19th National Congress of the CPC, major strategic arrangement was \nmade as follows: “deepening the comprehensive and supporting reform of \nthe judicial system and fully implementing the judicial accountability system \nso that people can experience fairness and justice in each case”, which \nmarks a new stage of the judicial system reform. Based on the realities of \ncourts, the Supreme People’s Court formulated the Opinions on Deepening \nthe Comprehensive and Supporting Reform of the Judicial System in the \nPeople’s Courts, namely the Fifth Five-Year Reform Program for People’s \nCourts 2019-2023 as an important program for instructing the people’s \ncourts to deepen the comprehensive and supporting reform of the judicial \nsystem in the next five years.\nOrganization and Implementation of the Court Reform in China\nIn early 2014, China set up the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively \nDeepening Reform headed by President Xi Jinping, which is responsible \nfor the overall design, arrangement, coordination, promotion and \nimplementation of the reform. In March 2018, it was renamed as the \nCentral Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission. Between \nJanuary 22, 2014 and December 31, 2018, the Central Leading Group for \nComprehensively Deepening Reform (hereinafter referred to as “CLGCDR”) \nand the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission \n(hereinafter referred to as “CCDRC”), in aggregate, held 45 meetings, \nconsidered and passed 35 documents relating to important reforms of \n法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd   71\n2019/03/01,星期五   17:42:01\n\n\n中国法院的司法改革（2013—2018）\n72\n-\n-\npeople’s courts.\nThe CCDRC has six special sub-groups, which are responsible for \nconsidering important issues relating to reforms in the relevant areas, \ncoordinating and advancing the formulation and implementation of special \nreform policies and measures. The Leading Group for Reform of the Social \nSystem (also called Central Leading Group for Reform of the Judicial \nSystem) is responsible for deepening the reform of the judicial system.\nThe reform of the judicial system covers a wide range of issues and has \nhigh policy sensitivity. In consideration that the improvement of classified \nmanagement of judicial personnel, improvement of judicial accountability, \nimprovement of job security of judicial personnel and promotion of \ncentralized management of personnel, financial and material resources of \nlocal courts below the provincial level are basic measures of the reform \nof the judicial system, according to the principle that major reforms shall \nbe first conducted on a pilot basis, China launched pilot reforms in respect \nof the aforesaid four issues in some provinces, autonomous regions and \nmunicipalities directly under the Central Government in three batches, to \naccumulate experience for advancing the reform in an all-round way. Since \nJune 2014, the first judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in 7 \nprovinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, namely \nShanghai, Jilin, Hubei, Guangdong, Hainan, Guizhou, and Qinghai. Since \nJune 2015, the second judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in \n11 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central \nGovernment, namely Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, \n法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd   72\n2019/03/01,星期五   17:42:01\n\n\n73\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts（2013-2018）\nZhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Shandong, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Ningxia. Since \nMarch 2016, the third judicial system reform pilots have been initiated in \nBeijing and other 13 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly \nunder the Central Government and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region \nProduction and Construction Corps. Since July 2016, these four major \nreforms have been implemented nationwide in an all-round way. \nThe Supreme People’s Court set up a leading group for judicial reform \nheaded by Chief Judge Zhou Qiang, responsible for organizing, leading, \narranging, and coordinating the judicial reform of courts, holding plenary \nand special meetings, overall planning of key issues of reform, considering \nreform proposals, discussing and deciding on major issues. Each higher \npeople’s court sets up a leading group for judicial reform, responsible for \nsupervising, guiding, arranging, and coordinating the judicial reform of \ncourts within its jurisdiction. Each higher people’s court’s proposal of pilot \nprogram for judicial reform is subject to examination and approval by the \nSupreme People’s Court, and if it involves any major reform, by the Central \nGovernment.\n法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd   73\n2019/03/01,星期五   17:42:01\n\n\n中国法院的司法改革（2013—2018）\n74\n-\n-\nII. Fully Implementing the Judicial Accountability System\nIt is both an objective requirement of the law of justice and a core content \nof the reform of the judicial system that one who tries a case shall have the \npower to decide the case and be responsible for his decision. In September \n2015, the Supreme People’s Court issued certain opinions on improving \nthe judicial accountability system in the people’s courts, establishing a \nnew type of operating mechanism of adjudicative power, to instruct the \ncourts nationwide to advance the reform of the judicial accountability \nsystem. In December 2018, the Supreme People’s Court issued opinions on \nfurther comprehensively implementing the judicial accountability system, \nproviding more guidance on issues such as improving the mechanism of \ntrial supervision and management and the mechanism of unified application \nof law, to promote full implementation of the judicial accountability \nsystem. Since the full implementation of the judicial accountability system \nreform, in courts nationwide, the number of first-line judicial personnel has \nincreased over 20%, the average number of cases handled by each person \nhas increased over 20%, and the rate of conclusion of cases has increased \nover 18%.\nImplementing accountability system for sole judges and collegiate \npanels handling cases. Fully respecting the status of sole judges and \ncollegiate panels as statutory judicial organs, most of the courts at all levels \n法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd   74\n2019/03/01,星期五   17:42:01\n\n\n75\n-\n-\nJudicial Reform of Chinese Courts（2013-2018）\nhave established an accountability system in which “one who tries a case \nshall have the power to decide the case and be responsible for his decision”, \nand have revoked the system of asking for instructions and examination and \napproval level by level. The written judgments formed through adjudication \nby collegiate panels or sole judges are issued upon signature by collegiate \npanel members or sole judges. Except the cases considered and decided \nby the judicial committees, court/tribunal presidents no longer review or \nsign the written judgments on the cases of which they have not directly \nparticipated in the trial. Since the reform, in courts nationwide, the number \nof cases on which the judgments are directly made by sole judges and \ncollegiate panels has reached over 98% of the total number of cases, and \nthe number of cases referred to judicial committees for discussion has fallen \nsharply. In Shanghai, since the launch of the reform, the ratio of the cases \ndirectly decided by the sole judges or collegiate panels has reached 99.99%, \nand only 0.1% of the cases concluded have been submitted to the judicial \ncommittees for discussion.\nFlexibly organizing the judicial team. According to laws and based \non actual circumstances, the primary people’s courts organize judicial \nteams with judge as the core member, and judge assistant, clerk and other \nauxiliary judicial personnel as the supporting members, describe the duties \nof judges, judge assistants and clerks, and improve the case handling \nmechanism with clear power and responsibility, consistency between power \nand responsibility, both division and cooperation, and orderly operation, \nby taking into overall consideration the separation of complicated cases \n法院的司法改革（2013-2018）.indd   75\n2019/03/01,星期五   17:42:01\n\n\n中国法院的司法改革（2013—2018）\n76\n-\n-\nfrom simple ones and the specialization of adjudication.
